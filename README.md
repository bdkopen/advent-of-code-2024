# Advent of Code

Code solution to problems featured in the yearly [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

## Objective
I am using Advent of Code as a way to learn Rust. I attempt to use best practices, but many of my solutions are written given my current understanding of Rust. As I learn, I will re-review and improve previous solutions.
